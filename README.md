1. All three algorithms can be run simulataneously through:
>python3 main.py

This will output the solution vector and the cost/score of this result in terminal,
    and cost, time and feasability to csv.

2. The files can also be run individually via:
Genetic Algorithm:
>python3 ga.py

Particle Swarm Optimisation:
>python3 pso.py

Ant Colony Optimisation:
>python3 aco.py

3. Results of running these algorithms is exported to 
Genetic Algorithm:
gaCostResults.csv

Particle Swarm Optimisation:
psoCostResults.csv

Ant Colony Optimisation:
acoCostResults.csv
